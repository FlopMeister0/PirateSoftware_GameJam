Thank you for checking out my game TanksAlot! To play, all you need to do is run the .exe file that is within the folder.

DO NOT REMOVE THE "DATA" FOLDER OR THE GAME WILL CRASH... Or if you want to. Have fun seeing things break!

Made for the piratesoftware gamejam before I head back for my 2nd semester, this was just a fun experiment with TileMapping and bringing more functionality to a game! This was made in pygame because why not. Any bugs then let me know!
